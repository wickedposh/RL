## Abstract 
Reinforcement Learning has succeeded at a wide range of games ( Chess,
Go, Atari ). Here we apply RL methods to a game-theoretic problem in eco-
nomics : a repeated pricing game between a Bayesian-updating producer
and a consumer with private willingness-to-pay. We established existence
of the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the continuous-action extension
through Reny (1999), which we then approximate computationally via three
RL methods. We have used three different approaches (Monte Carlo, Q-
learning, Deep Q-Network) to simulate the benefits of randomisation for con-
sumer’s behaviour. All three approaches show a consistent result that ϵ∗ < 1,
supporting randomisation as an obfuscation strategy. Tabular Q-learning
shows no clear monotonic trend in ϵ∗(β), while DQN recovers the monotone
decrease predicted by Monte Carlo, reconciling the previously-observed dis-
crepancy. We empirically validate the Karp-Kleinberg lower bound on poste-
rior variance, confirming that mixed strategies prevent posterior collapse.





  ## Results
  All three methods find optimal ε* < 1 — randomisation improves consumer 
  surplus. DQN recovers the monotone ε*(β) trend that tabular Q-learning's
  discretisation misses.
